Quick start (no-code):
1. Create a GitHub repo and upload the contents of this ZIP to the repo root.
2. In GitHub Actions, run the 'Android Build (debug)' workflow to produce an APK artifact.
3. Use Docker (optional) to run backend locally: docker-compose up -d then apply migrations with psql.
See README and scripts for more details.
